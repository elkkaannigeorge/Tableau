Soil Pollution and Associated Health Impacts â€“ Tableau Dashboard
This project explores the relationship between soil pollution and human health outcomes using interactive visualizations in Tableau. Based on a Kaggle dataset, it examines pollutant concentrations, disease types, and mitigation measures across different regions and demographics.

Objectives
Analyze pollutant types and their health impacts

Visualize the spread and severity of diseases linked to soil contamination

Track mitigation measures and their effectiveness

Enable data-driven policy insights through dynamic dashboards
